                    <p>
                        Hi! I'm Matteo Trovato from Catania, a master student of Economics and Business and now I'm in Belgrade for Erasmus. The subjects I'm studying at the University of Belgrade are:

                <h2>My passion</h2>
                    <p style="background-color: black; color: red;">I am a huge sports enthusiast, particularly a fan of <a href="https://www.acmilan.com/en">Ac Milan</a>, the most successful Italian team in Europe, currently playing in the top tier of the Italian championship. This passion of mine was passed down to me by my father, with whom I often go to the stadium to watch matches. Despite living far from Milan, we make some sacrifices to ensure we don't miss the most important games.</p>

                <h3>Family Business</h3>
            <p>
                In a town a few kilometers from Catania, my family runs three stores. The main store, which is also the largest, is called <a href="https://www.sportivogiarre.com">Sportivo Emozioni Sensazioni</a> and offers clothing for men, women, and children, ranging from sportswear to elegant attire, with a wide assortment of products. The second store, in chronological order, is the Outlet, located in the center of Giarre, which sells unsold stock from the main store. Finally, Pippo Junior is the third store, entirely dedicated to children, with a more focused selection of footwear but also some clothing items to meet the needs of our customers.
